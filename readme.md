I want practice frontend skills with VanillaJS, I was choosing among [a lot of open APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and I decanted for [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/).  
This will be so interesting!  
Basicly, I will build a web page to check a random fact that happend in a special day to you.

I sketched a wireframe about how I imagined this. [Check here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aLKxvHC9zRjFmwpK9).  
Then I made its mockup in figma. [Check here](https://www.figma.com/file/I673kIvzYcl6RmGANvdKrB/APOD-Astronomy-Picture-Of-the-Day).
